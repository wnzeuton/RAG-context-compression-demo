Early Activism (2030–2032)
In 2030, Kruger began organizing workshops and seminars addressing the societal effects of automation in logistics and transportation. These sessions sought to educate workers, policymakers, and the public on the potential risks and benefits of autonomous systems. By 2031, Kruger gained national attention as a spokesperson during the Rotterdam Dockworker Walkouts, where unions protested the implementation of fully autonomous port operations. Her speeches highlighted the displacement of labor, ethical responsibilities of corporations, and the need for human oversight in automated systems. Widespread media coverage established her as a prominent voice in labor advocacy across Europe.
In 2032, Kruger testified before the European Trade Assembly on matters of automation regulation. She emphasized the necessity of mandatory human oversight in logistics hubs and proposed concrete safeguards for displaced workers. Her advocacy directly influenced the drafting of the Human Override Statute, a landmark piece of legislation mandating worker oversight in automated environments, which became a cornerstone of European labor law.

Leadership in Labor Networks (2033–2035)
Kruger co-founded the Transnational Labor Futures Network in 2033, a coalition connecting unions from automated ports and industrial sectors across Europe. As coordinator, she organized cross-border strikes, labor negotiations, and strategic campaigns emphasizing data-driven advocacy. Her leadership approach combined grassroots organizing with economic modeling, creating a new template for labor activism in the automated era.
In 2034, she published a widely cited report on labor displacement metrics, combining firsthand accounts from workers with quantitative economic models. Policymakers and industry leaders utilized this work to assess the risks of automation and implement targeted interventions. The following year, Kruger shifted focus toward retraining programs for displaced workers, collaborating with technical institutes to design automation literacy curricula. Pilot programs in Northern European port cities reported positive outcomes, increasing re-employment rates and fostering skill adaptation in industrial communities.

Political Career (2036–2042)
Kruger formally entered politics in 2036, running for a seat in the European Trade Assembly on a platform emphasizing ethical automation, transparency, and worker transition guarantees. Her campaign resonated strongly in industrial regions, and she won her seat with broad support. As a legislator, she authored amendments to strengthen worker protections, championed public audits of logistics AI systems, and promoted transparency in automated decision-making. Several of her proposals were adopted, signaling a shift in European labor governance toward ethical oversight.
In 2038, Kruger was appointed chair of the Assembly’s Committee on Labor and Technology. Under her leadership, the committee expanded its investigative powers, launching inquiries into automation abuses across multiple industries. She also authored a policy framework for international automation standards in 2039, which was adopted as a reference by several trade blocs and recognized for harmonizing labor protections across borders.
In addition to her legislative work, Kruger began teaching part-time at a European policy institute in 2040, lecturing on labor history, technological change, and industrial ethics. Her academic work complemented her political efforts and allowed her to influence a new generation of policymakers. In 2041, she published a book analyzing automation’s impact on democratic institutions, receiving critical acclaim for its clarity and depth.
After stepping down from her committee chair in 2042, Kruger focused on long-term labor transition planning, emphasizing sustainable and intergenerational policy solutions. She remained an influential voice in Assembly debates and policy formulation.
